Detailed Explanation of User Roles and Permissions
The WMGInvent system implements a robust role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism to ensure secure and efficient management of inventory data. Three distinct user roles are defined: Customer, Admin, and Site Admin, each with specific permissions tailored to their responsibilities.

1. Customer: Customers have basic access, allowing them to browse available products, view detailed product information, and place orders. They can also track their order history and status, ensuring transparency and enhancing user experience.

2. Admin: Admin users have elevated permissions, including the ability to manage product information comprehensively. They can add new products, update existing product details, and manage stock levels. Admins also handle order processing, updating order statuses, and managing stock replenishment requests. However, they do not have permissions to delete products or manage user accounts, ensuring data integrity and security.

3. Site Admin: Site Admins possess the highest level of access, encompassing all Admin permissions and additional capabilities. They can create and delete products, manage user accounts, assign roles, and configure system-wide settings. This role is critical for maintaining overall system health, security, and operational efficiency.

Enhanced Security Measures
Security is paramount in inventory management systems, especially when handling sensitive business data. WMGInvent incorporates several advanced security measures:

- Password Encryption: Utilizes Werkzeug's secure hashing algorithms to store passwords safely, significantly reducing the risk of credential theft.
- CSRF Protection: Implements Flask-WTF to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, ensuring secure form submissions.
- Audit Logging: Records critical actions performed by Admin and Site Admin users, providing traceability and accountability.

User Feedback and Continuous Improvement
To ensure WMGInvent remains effective and user-friendly, a structured feedback mechanism has been implemented. Users can submit feedback directly through the application, which is reviewed regularly to identify areas for improvement. This iterative feedback loop has already led to several enhancements, including improved navigation, clearer product categorization, and faster load times.

Future iterations will continue to prioritize user feedback, focusing on:
- Enhanced user interface customization options.
- Improved mobile responsiveness.
- Additional reporting capabilities based on user requests.
